# Object-Oriented-Programming-Rick-and-Morty
The Rick and Morty game utilizes interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, encapsulation and other concepts from Object-Oriented Programming. 
The java files are contained in the src folder and you can run the game in the VirtualWorld class. 
Clicking grid locations not occupied by entities creates a Rick that tracks down the nearest Dude and teleports the Dude to the selected location.
