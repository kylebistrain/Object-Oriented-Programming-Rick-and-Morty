1. Q:how to trigger the event
To trigger the event, you must click on a square in the grid that does
not currently have an entity on it. If there is an entity there it will not trigger the event.
2. Q:what should happen when the event is triggered
When the event is triggered a green portal with a 2x2 size will pop up on the screen.
Additionally, a rick entity will appear and will move to the nearest DudeFull or DudeNotFull.
3. Q: what the affected entities should do
Once the rick is adjacent to the rick the Dude or DudeNotFull will teleport to the portal location and the Rick will try to find the next DudeFull or DudeNotFull.
4. Q: what the new entity is and how it should behave
The new Entity is a Rick(from Rick and Morty) and the goal of the rick is to move to the nearest DudeFull or DudeNotFull. Once it is adjacent to the nearest DudeFull or DudeNotFull,
it teleports the DudeFull or DudeNotFull to the portal in which the rick spawned from. Also, once a rick is teleported the rick looks
to find another DudeFull or DudeNotFull elsewhere on the grid.
